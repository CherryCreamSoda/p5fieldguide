# ‚ù§ Welcome to Hell

### Hello!

This page is a repository that I will slowly update over time with knowledge I've gathered on editing/creating fields in Persona 5 over the last year! \
\
Please use the Table of Contents on the left hand side to find your desired info.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please Note! This is a repository of info and **not a tutorial** on anything in particular! It is meant to be used as reference and documentation for Persona 5 Modders who already have at least _some_ experience in this area and it is not for the faint of heart.\
\
If you have any questions ask around on the official Persona Modding discord and there will be those around who can assist you.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This repository was made by CherryCreamSoda for the benefit of the community and couldn't be achieved without the research assistance and support from the Amicitia Modding group, thank you to all who have contributed in the last year.
