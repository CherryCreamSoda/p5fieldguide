# ðŸ›  Persona 5 Field Repository



![I don't know who this is, I just thought it'd be really funny to put this on the top of an otherwise completely serious Wiki](.gitbook/assets/HelpfulIntroduction.png)

### Hello!

This page is a repository that I will slowly update over time with knowledge I've gathered on editing/creating fields in Persona 5 over the last year! \
\
Please use the Table of Contents on the left hand side to find your desired info.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please Note! This is a repository of info and **not a tutorial** on anything in particular! It is meant to be used as reference and documentation for Persona 5 Modders who already have at least _some_ experience in this area and it is not for the faint of heart.\
\
If you have any questions ask around on the official Persona Modding discord and there will be those around who can assist you.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

This repository was made by CherryCreamSoda for the benefit of the community and couldn't be achieved without the research assistance and support from the Amicitia Modding group. \
Thank you to all who have contributed in the last year and my personal love and respect to you all.\
