### Greetings Trickster!

This page is an info repository with documentation I've gathered on editing/creating fields in Persona 5 over the last year. \
\
Please use the Table of Contents on the left hand side to find your desired info.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please Note! This is a repository of info and **not a tutorial** on anything in particular! It is meant to be used as reference and documentation for Persona 5 Modders who already have at least _some_ experience in this area and it is not for the faint of heart.\
\
If you have any questions ask around on the official Persona Modding discord and there will be those around who can assist you.
{% endhint %}

### Important Notice

{% hint style="success" %}
This has been written with the intent to be informative, but as format-friendly with screen readers and readability plugins as possible within the limitations of Gitbook to ease the experience for Neurodivergent people. Feel free to suggest edits to me on Discord for any edits pertaining either to accuracy of information, phrasing or accessibility.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Credits and Roles

This repo was made for the benefit of the community and couldn't be achieved without the research assistance and support from the Amicitia Modding Group. \
Thank you to all who have contributed in the last year and my personal love and respect to you all.\
